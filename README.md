# c-EventDrivenStateMachine
A Event-Driven Finite State Machine written in C for Embedded Systems.
In the programming field, a event-driven state machine is charecterized if the transitions from one state to another is triggered by an event or a message.
This example is written in standard C language, where a car transmission system can be in one of the following states:
* Forward;
* Neutral;
* Reverse.

But we can't go to Reverse gear directly from Forward and vice-versa; we need to pass thru Neutral before. Also, in this simple example, we can turn off the engine (i.e. quit the program) only at the Neutral state.

The events and states are associated in a bidimensional array like this example:
~~~
void (* State_Event_Matrix[EVENT][STATE]) () =
{
    {   // Event Neutral_btn click
        Not_Valid,      // callback function called when Neutral_btn clicked at NEUTRAL STATE
        Neutral,        // callback function called when Neutral_btn clicked at FORWARD STATE
        Neutral,        // callback function called when Neutral_btn clicked at REVERSE STATE
    },
    {   // Event Reverse_btn click
        Reverse,        // State NEUTRAL
        Not_Valid,      // State FORWARD
        Not_Valid,      // State REVERSE
    },
    {   // Event Forward_btn click
        Forward,        // State NEUTRAL
        Not_Valid,      // State FORWARD
        Not_Valid,      // State REVERSE
    },
    {   // Event Quit_btn click
        QuitProgram,        // State NEUTRAL
        Not_Valid,          // State FORWARD
        Not_Valid,          // State REVERSE
    }
};
~~~
The sequence of the events listed above should be in the same order as declared in the enum:
~~~
enum {
    NEUTRAL,
    FORWARD,
    REVERSE
}; // all the valid states

enum {
    NEUTRAL_BTN,
    REVERSE_BTN,
    FORWARD_BTN,
    QUIT_BTN
}; // all the possible events
~~~
